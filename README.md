# slot_machine_animation

### The project involves a slot machine animation based on the concept of a vending machine, where winner is decided by the game of chance.

### Can it be used as a package as well?
```
yes we publish it as package 
as well , with only three parmas
required for it. 

```

```
LuckyDarw(

participants: List<Strings>,
height: height,
width: width,

);
```

### Can i add mutiple winner options?

```
Yes, we customise the package to select 
multiple users as well, with each user
getting selected one at a time with
continuous animation in between.
```
